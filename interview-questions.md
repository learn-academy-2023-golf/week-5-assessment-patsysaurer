# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. Compare and contrast arrays and hashes in Ruby. Include at least two differences and two similarities.

Your answer: Arrays and hashes are both a collection of data and they can both be iterated over. Some differences are that arrays are zero indexed and hashes use key value pairs to store data. Hashes use colons : to access the symbol and arrays use brackets [] to access the element.  

Researched answer: Arrays and Hashes are both collections used to store and retrieve data. Arrays are used for to list data, whereas a hash is a collection of pairs of information with a name and value. Kind of like a more "specific" list. 

For example, an array could contain a basic grocery list: eggs, milk, bread and a hash could contain a detailed list: "eggs"=>"Egglands Best", "milk"=>"Soy", "bread"=>"Wheat"

2. What does it mean to implement a TTD workflow? 

Your answer: A Test Driven Development workflow is important for developers to practice to prevent bugs in their code. If the test is written first it can determine whether or not it will work properly or if it is even available to use. 

Researched answer: The main purpose of TDD is for clarity. By having a user story, the developer can understand what the problem is and break it down into coding terms to help such as objects and behaviors. This makes it easier to write the function when you know which objects to give actions.

3. Why would super be used in a Ruby class? 

Your answer: Super would be used in a Ruby class to categorize data into a more broad form. For example a super class would be great to hold a Cake recipe and a subclass would be great to hold a Honey Cake recipe that inherits most of the ingredients and just adds a few to customize it into a flavored cake. 

Researched answer: Super class is used for reusability and great for sharing methods to subclasses without having to write more code. The super keyword allows for method overriding and customization. 

4. STRETCH: What is the difference between inheritance in JavaScript and inheritance in Ruby?

Researched answer: Ruby uses a more modern inheritance model that is based on classes and single inheritance(meaning only one parent class -superclass). While JavaScript uses a more traditional model and uses prototype-based inheritance, where objects are linked to other objects using dot notation.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. PostgreSQL: one type of SQL(Structured Query Language) that is open-source and is a management system for object-relational data. It is a database that uses OOP and a primary key to hold the incoming data safely and organized into a table.

2. Ruby on Rails: the framework built in Ruby for writing full-stack web applications using the MVC pattern. Model, view and controller architectural pattern that provides methods for certain responsibilities within an application. The database, user's view, functionality that handles the data. 

3. Active Record: The connector for Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL to communicate and work together like a translator. Using OOP, to allow developers to interact with the data as a if it were a Ruby object.
